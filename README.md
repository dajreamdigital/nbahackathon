Our web app allows you to search an NBA player and see how his activity on social media affects his performance as a teammate on the court, measured by five different statstics. We also present the data compared to the rest of the team. 

Currently we support only the Cavaliers players from the 2015-2016 season.

This was created using Python/Flask interacting with the Twitter API, with Chart.js for visualizations and data provided by the NBA. We used Twitter to provide us with the number of tweets for each player for approimately the past two weeks, since this is the maximum that Twitter supports.  

Demo it here: http://nbahackathon.herokuapp.com/.
